# Lean Coffee

An interactive Lean Coffee board that helps teams crowdsource discussion topics, vote on what matters most, and keep conversations timeboxed.

## Features

- Propose topics with optional context and capture notes as you go.
- Dot voting with configurable vote budgets stored locally per participant.
- Prioritized “To Discuss” backlog that automatically sorts by votes.
- Simple flow across **To Discuss → Discussing → Discussed** columns with quick actions.
- Built-in timer with extend/reset controls and a prompt when the timebox finishes.
- Export the session as a Markdown summary for easy sharing.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to run the board locally. All votes, topics, and notes are persisted in your browser storage so you can refresh the page without losing progress.

To reset the board, use the **Reset Session** button in the header. To capture meeting outcomes, click **Export Notes** to download a Markdown file with the current state of the board.
